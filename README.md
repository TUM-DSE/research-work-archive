## Before starting your research work

The student or the advisor(s) should update the active research [list](./active_research.md) with the subject and the start and end dates.

## After finishing your research work

Once you are done with your research work at our chair, please submit a pull
request to add your GR/IDP report, your BSc/MSc thesis or your final
presentation to this archive. Please also remove the thesis from the list of active theses.

We follow a strict naming convention for systematic archival of the documents.
We collect the documents in year- and semester-wise folders, and classify them
by the type (BSc/MSc thesis, GR, IDP).

Steps to add your research work to the archive:

1. Select the appropriate year and semester folder -- __Based on the submission date__
2. Add your final presentation to the `talks` folder
3. Add your final report or your final thesis to the `docs` folder
4. Include your research work in the `README.md` in the year folder
5. Submit a pull request. __Please contain all modifications (report/slide/README) in one pull request!__

You do not need to update statistics.md. It will be automatically updated.

## Hints on year and semester folders

If the research work was submitted between 1st of April and the last day of
September, it was a summer semester. Else a winter semester. If the work was
submitted in winter semester, please put it in the year folder belonging to the
start of the winter semester, i.e., if the winter semester is 22/23 please put
it into 2022 (even if the work was submitted in the first three months of
2023). Thanks!

## Format

Please follow this format for your file names:

```
<type>_<lastname>.pdf
```

where

* `<type>` is either `bsc`, `msc`, `idp` or `gr`
* `<lastname>` is your last name. If there are conflicts, also add your first name.

And you are done, **thank you**!
